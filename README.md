# 0/1 Knapsack Zoo Trip Simulator

This project simulates an optimal zoo visit using a bottom-up dynamic programming solution to the classic 0/1 Knapsack problem.

## 📌 Description

Given a list of zoo exhibits (with "fun" value and time cost), this program finds the most fun combination of exhibits that can be visited within a limited total time.

Used in an academic context to demonstrate understanding of dynamic programming concepts.

## 🧠 Algorithm

- Approach: Bottom-up Dynamic Programming  
- Optimization Goal: Maximize total "fun value" within a time constraint  
- Complexity: O(nW), where `n` = number of exhibits, `W` = max total time  

## 💻 How to Run

```bash
python3 KnapsackCorrectedFinal.py
```

You can adjust the list of exhibits and total available time in the code.

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3  
- Dynamic Programming  

## 📄 Sample Output

```
Most fun possible: 86
Exhibits visited: ['Tiger Cage', 'Monkey Island', 'Reptile House']
```
